When reading through code on an assessment, consider the scope of the question.
With that in mind, answer the following questions about all of the code:

- What is the type of action being performed (method call, block, conditional, etc..)?
- What is the object that action is being performed on?
- What is the side effect of that action (e.g. output or destructive action)?
- What is the return value of that action?
- Is the return value used by whatever instigated the action? 

Answer all of these questions then decide which parts of your answer may be unnecessary to the context
of the question, if any, and discord those. Then use the remaining information to formulate a proper answer.
